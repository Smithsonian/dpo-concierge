## Migration and Workflow Tool.

Concierge is part of the Smithsonian Digitization Program Office's 3D foundation pipeline. As a workflow and repository
 tool, it serves as the connecting point between other components of the pipeline, in particular Voyager, the 3D
 authoring and exploration tool, and Cook, the 3D data processing component.

### Pre-Release Software

Concierge is in a very early stage of development. Its current focus is to provide a migration path from the
Smithsonian's legacy 3D publishing tool (Autodesk Play) to the new Voyager 3D Explorer.

Concierge also serves as a proof of concept for a full workflow and repository solution with fully customizable
workflow recipes. At this point however, there are no plans yet to continue the development of Concierge beyond
the basic migration functionality.

This is preview software and provided "as is". Breaking changes can and will happen during development.
